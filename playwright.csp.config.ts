 * The one run that applies the production security headers.

 * `astro dev` and `astro preview` serve public/_headers as a file and never as
 * headers, so the main Playwright run is green on a policy that blocks the
 * whole site. That is exactly how a CSP that stopped every island hydrating
 * reached a deployed preview. `wrangler pages dev` reads _headers and _redirects
 * the way Cloudflare Pages does, which makes the failure reproducible here.
 *
 * Kept in its own config and its own directory so the main run cannot pick these
 * specs up and pass them against a server that sends no policy at all.
