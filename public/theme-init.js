 * an inline script would be blocked and the page would flash the system theme
 * before correcting itself. Loaded synchronously from <head>, this runs before
 * the body renders.
 *
 * No stored value means "follow the system", which the CSS handles on its own
 * through prefers-color-scheme, so nothing is written to the document then.
